My digital legacy...

“Could someone in the future transform my website into a digital avatar of me?”

BTW, if you are aliens, time travelers, or espers, please contact me now!

## About Me

I’m Fulong, a power electronics engineer and researcher based in the UK, 
specializing in advanced converter design, control strategies, 
and energy-system integration.

Beyond engineering, I’m also a novelist who enjoys exploring ideas about technology, 
humanity, and destiny through storytelling. Writing allows me to capture experiences, 
question assumptions, and express the creative side that complements my technical work.

Through Spirit Connect, I hope to build an open, collaborative community 
where engineers, researchers, hobbyists, and creators of all kinds can share knowledge, 
exchange ideas, and contribute to an open-source ecosystem that makes 
power electronics more accessible, and more inspiring for everyone.

## Beyond Work

Outside of engineering, I enjoy creative writing and have drafted several science-fiction novels. I’m fascinated by the intersection of technology, storytelling, and society.
