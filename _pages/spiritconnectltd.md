# Welcome to Spirit Connect Group

We are a community of power electronics enthusiasts passionate about learning, building, and sharing knowledge.
Our mission is to make power electronics open and accessible — from converter design and control to wide-bandgap device applications and DC microgrids.

We believe that engineering grows stronger through collaboration and openness.
That’s why we’re creating an open-source knowledge hub for power electronics — where ideas, models, and tools can be freely shared, improved, and reimagined together.

Join us as we connect engineers, researchers, and learners around the world,
to power the future — one open circuit at a time.
