## Overview

This section introduces the **topologies, modelling, and control** of both **DC–DC** and **AC–DC** converters used across power electronics applications.

We start with **non-isolated converters** — simple but fundamental building blocks — then move into more advanced **bidirectional** and **AC interface** topologies.

## Non-Isolated DC–DC Converters

Non-isolated converters provide direct voltage transformation without galvanic isolation. They are widely used due to simplicity, high efficiency, and compact design.

| Topology | Description | GitHub Repo                                                                  |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Buck** | Steps down input voltage to a lower output level. Common in point-of-load supplies and embedded systems. | [Buck Converter Repo](https://github.com/FulongLi/NonisolatedCoverters)            |
| **Boost** | Steps up input voltage to a higher output level. Useful in LED drivers, renewable energy interfaces, and battery applications. | [Boost Converter Repo](https://github.com/FulongLi/NonisolatedCoverters)          |
