# Overview

DC microgrids are localized power systems that distribute and regulate energy using direct-current architectures. 
By eliminating unnecessary AC–DC conversions, they offer higher efficiency, 
simpler power flow control, and improved integration of renewable sources, 
energy storage systems, and DC-native loads such as EV chargers, data centers, 
and consumer electronics. DC microgrids can operate in grid-connected or islanded mode, 
providing enhanced reliability and flexibility for modern distributed energy applications. 
As the demand for clean and efficient power grows, 
DC microgrids are becoming a key enabler for future low-carbon, intelligent energy infrastructures.
