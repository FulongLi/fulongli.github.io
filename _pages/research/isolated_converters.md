## Overview

This section introduces the **topologies, modelling, and control** of isolated DC–DC converters.  
Unlike non-isolated converters, these topologies use **galvanic isolation** (often with high-frequency transformers) to provide safety, meet regulatory requirements, and allow large step-up or step-down voltage ratios.

## Isolated DC–DC Converter Summary

| Topology | Description | GitHub Repo |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Dual Active Bridge (DAB)** | Widely used for high-power bidirectional energy transfer. Achieves soft-switching (ZVS) and high efficiency at medium–high power levels. | [DAB Converter Repo](https://github.com/yourname/dab-converter) |
| **LLC Resonant Converter** | High efficiency and soft-switching over wide load range. Common in server power supplies, EV chargers, and telecom applications. | [LLC Converter Repo](https://github.com/yourname/llc-converter) |
| **Full-Bridge Converter** | Classic isolated topology, robust and suitable for wide input/output ranges. | [Full-Bridge Converter Repo](https://github.com/yourname/fullbridge-converter) |
