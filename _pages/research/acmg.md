## Overview


AC microgrids are localized energy networks that integrate distributed generators, 
energy storage, and controllable loads within an AC-based architecture. 
They can operate in both grid-connected and islanded modes, providing enhanced reliability, 
power quality, and resilience for modern energy systems. 
With increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, 
AC microgrids play a key role in balancing intermittent generation, 
enabling flexible control strategies, 
and supporting the transition toward smarter and more sustainable power infrastructures.
