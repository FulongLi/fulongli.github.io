## Heated Rivalry 的观感

整个圣诞都在等《Stranger Things》，却无意中刷到了《Heated Rivalry》。

刚开始以为就是部简单的“肉片”，看了两集就没再看下去了。可未曾想到，之后将其当做日常背景音乐听时，最后两集竟是如此震撼感动，以至于我循环播放了好几遍。 

总结一句话：爱，由性发散，收敛于灵魂交融。

没想到这部片能将同性之间的爱情拍得如此细腻，上一部让我有如此感受的还是《Normal People》。人们对于异性情感的拍摄和描述，似乎总是不厌其烦地花费时间、金钱，找顶尖的演员和巨额制作成本；在这样的背景下，《Heated Rivalry》的成功显得尤为可贵。

故事的发生和制作都在加拿大，细想也并不意外。放眼全球，能够将西方主流价值观与东方细腻情感相结合，并搬上大荧幕让全世界产生共鸣的作品，大概也只有加拿大了。美国太过于奔放直接，东亚太过于含蓄且受限于特定的文化，很难创作出如此明朗的同性作品，大多以悲剧结尾。欧洲的情感虽也细腻，但多局限于异性作品；对于同性的刻画，要么过于保守，要么过于奔放，很难将那种“爱本身”的细腻情感表达出来。

我想，这也是《Heated Rivalry》成功的地方。演员精湛的演技很大程度上决定了作品的质感。Shane 的演员将人物内心世界的情感，都通过微妙的面部表情和极具打动人心的眼神表达了出来；而 Ilya 对于自我的情感封闭，源于他的成长环境和独特的俄罗斯文化背景，让他深陷于自我身份认同的纠结与挣扎。导演独特的光影审美将这部作品的张力拿捏到了极致，成功似乎是必然。

当我迫不及待想要知道后续发展去读了原著小说时，发现显然没有剧集精彩。这也是鲜有的一部剧改比原著更出色的作品。原著的肉文描写对我而言，有些喧宾夺主了。

在现如今电子快餐消费的主流文化中，《Heated Rivalry》的细腻情感和最后两集平缓的叙事节奏，真的是一股清流。我想这部剧的大火，也反映了大众当下的诉求：人们不是厌倦了爱情的拉扯，只是厌倦了无病呻吟的拉扯。

剧中有好几个场景，百看不厌，时看时新，甚至是足以载入影史的镜头。

Shane 和 Ilya 在沙发对坐长谈，Shane 求 Ilya 不要结婚，因为一想到深爱之人要和别人入场，眼泪便不受控制地流。而 Ilya 用脚不停地安抚他。Shane 因为这件事彻夜难眠，思考未来的规划——因为深爱一个人，才会拼命想要谋划和他在一起的未来。而 Ilya 也在 Shane 的规划中彻底放下了身上所有的防御，表达了爱意。那种历经十年之久的爱情拉扯，终于亲口说了出来。

与以往异性爱情不同的是，往往在捅破那层窗户纸后，叙事容易趋于平淡，因为成百上千万的人类样本都在告诉我们一件事：顺其自然地结婚、生娃、回归家庭。而对于同性爱情，他们未来需要克服的问题远没有结束，我想这大概也是剧中即便互表心意后，剧情也并没有走向平庸的原因之一吧。

故事中的几个地点，蒙特利尔和渥太华，是之前疫情没去成的两个城市，要不然加拿大的大城市就都打卡完了。我要把这件事提上日程。依然忘不了 2019 年的夏天，时间过得真快，转眼已经快 7 个年头过去了。

Thank you, Canada, for 2025 Christmas.

## Reflections on Heated Rivalry

I spent the entire Christmas holiday waiting for Stranger Things, only to stumble upon Heated Rivalry by accident.

At first, I dismissed it as just another shallow, steamy flick and stopped watching after two episodes. Little did I know that when I later picked it up again as background noise, the final two episodes would be so profoundly moving. They were so hauntingly beautiful that I found myself rewatching them on a loop.

If I had to sum it up in one sentence: Love radiates from the physical, but converges in the union of souls.

I never expected this series to capture the nuances of queer love with such delicacy. The last time a show made me feel this way was Normal People. In mainstream media, it seems we never tire of spending immense time, money, and effort—hiring top-tier actors and pouring in massive budgets—to depict heterosexual romance. Against that backdrop, the success of Heated Rivalry feels especially precious.

The story is set and produced in Canada, which, upon reflection, isn't surprising. Looking at the global landscape, Canada seems uniquely positioned to blend Western mainstream values with Eastern-style emotional delicacy, bringing it to the big screen in a way the whole world can feel. America is often too bold and direct; East Asia is often too reserved and culturally specific, making it difficult to create such "bright" queer works, which often end in tragedy. Europe has its own delicacy, but it is largely reserved for heterosexual stories. When it comes to queer portrayals, European cinema often swings between being too conservative or too transgressive, rarely capturing the subtle feeling of "love for love’s sake."

I believe this is the secret to the success of Heated Rivalry. The masterful acting defines the quality of the work. The actor playing Shane conveys the character’s entire inner world through subtle facial expressions and incredibly moving eyes. Ilya’s emotional guardedness, rooted in his upbringing and his unique Russian cultural background, shows his struggle and friction with his own identity. Combined with the director’s unique aesthetic for light and shadow, the tension is pushed to the limit. Success was inevitable.

Driven by a desperate need to know what happens next, I turned to the original novel, but found it wasn't as compelling as the series. This is one of those rare cases where the adaptation outshines the source material. For me, the explicit nature of the book felt a bit too "overpowering," distracting from the emotional core.

In today’s culture of fast-paced "digital fast food," the delicate emotions and the steady, unhurried narrative of the final two episodes are a breath of fresh air. I think the show’s popularity reflects a modern longing: people aren't tired of the "push and pull" of romance; they are just tired of the hollow, performative version of it.

There are several scenes I could watch a hundred times and still find something new—shots that deserve to be in the halls of cinematic history.

Shane and Ilya sitting opposite each other on the sofa, talking deeply. Shane begs Ilya not to get married, his tears falling uncontrollably at the mere thought of the man he loves belonging to someone else. Meanwhile, Ilya uses his foot to continuously soothe him. That night, Shane lies awake, desperately mapping out a future for them—because when you truly love someone, you fight to plan a life where they exist. In response to Shane’s vulnerability, Ilya finally drops all his defenses and confesses his love. That emotional tug-of-war, ten years in the making, was finally given voice.

Unlike many heterosexual romances where the narrative flattens out once the "glass partition" is broken, this story remains vital. History and millions of human examples tell us that the "natural" next step is marriage, children, and a return to the mundane. But for a queer couple, the obstacles they must overcome in the future are far from over. I think that is why the story doesn't become mediocre even after they confess their feelings.

The story visits Montreal and Ottawa—two cities I missed out on during the pandemic. Otherwise, I would have checked off every major city in Canada by now. I need to put that back on the agenda. I still can't forget the summer of 2019; time flies so fast, nearly seven years have passed in the blink of an eye.

Thank you, Canada, for Christmas 2025.
