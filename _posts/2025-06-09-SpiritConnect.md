## A New Direction

Today marks the beginning of **Spirit Connect** as more than a personal project —  
it is becoming a **community for open-source power electronics**, dedicated to sharing knowledge, tools, and best practices across the industry.

For years, power electronics has been limited by fragmented data, closed-door design processes, and inaccessible expertise.  

Spirit Connect aims to change that.

## What Spirit Connect Stands For

- **Open Knowledge**  
  Curating datasets, models, and design resources freely accessible to engineers, students, and enthusiasts.

- **Collaborative Learning**  
  Bringing people together to discuss converter topologies, magnetics, WBG devices, and control methods.

- **Practical Tools**  
  From simulation templates to component databases, our goal is to build a collective toolkit that accelerates innovation.

- **Bridging Academia & Industry**  
  Sharing insights, case studies, measurements, and real-world design notes to reduce the gap between theory and application.

## Our Vision

To create the world’s most vibrant **open-source power electronics ecosystem** —  
a place where contributors from any background can learn, build, and innovate together.

We believe that by opening up data, models, and methods, the entire field can progress faster, become more transparent, and empower the next generation of power-electronics engineers.
