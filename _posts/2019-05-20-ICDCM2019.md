Keywords: Poster presentation

## Summary

I participated in the **IEEE International Conference on DC Microgrids (ICDCM) 2019**, held in Matsue, Japan, where I presented a **poster** on a novel stability design method for DC microgrids using terminal capacitor compensation.

## Research Focus

This work proposed a **capacitor-based compensation strategy** to improve the small-signal stability of droop-controlled DC microgrids. It offers a simple and effective method to enhance robustness without requiring complex communication.
