## 人类在现代数字文明中的潜在走向？

深度沉浸 AI 几个月后，仿佛穿越到了未来，窥见了未来的场景。

虽然短暂陷入过虚无主义，但那一定是一个个人天赋绽放的时代：音乐、美术、视频、编程、专业知识、教育、医疗、游戏、经济。

音乐人的天塌了。 下面是一段 AI 音乐软件 Suno 合成的音乐，用 Ariana 和比伯的声音唱周杰伦的《One Last Time + 珊瑚海》。

是不是听完感觉还挺棒的？

美术和视频在 Sora 2 出来之后就是不小的冲击了，然后谷歌的 Nano Banana 更是雪上加霜。

编程就不说了。 年初做日本项目的时候，第一次探索 Cursor，那时已经感受到冲击了，而现在 Cursor 可以做 Agent 了，更是震撼。我能够明白为啥硅谷科技大厂大规模裁员了，因为不再被需要了。

我们都是时代中的一粒沙。大浪淘尽，可能最后只有 20% 的人存活下来，继续上一个工业革命带来的工作模式和社会运营机制。

我想，新一轮的工业革命已经开始了。

2025 年底或 2026 年，看看未来的人们如何来书写、定义这段历史。

医疗方面， 我想对于这个非常强调记忆和经验的学科，AI 取代这个行业太容易了，甚至是降维打击。至少对于 NHS 的那些全科医生（GP）来说，他们将完全不再被需要，只不过 AI 现在还没有拿到开处方药的许可。

教育、游戏、经济，千千万万说不尽……

如果没有不可抗力中断 AI 发展，AI 几乎可以给每个个体赋能，让所有人都有机会真正地站在巨人的肩膀上。语言或想象力，将是唯一的认知边界。

这样想来，AI 不就是现代人造的阿卡西记录吗！

年初以为电力电子还有行业的门槛作为护城河，年末已经完全放弃了这个想法。

2026，让暴风雨来得更猛烈些吧！

## Where is Humanity Headed in the Age of Digital Civilization?

After being deeply immersed in AI for a few months, I feel as though I’ve traveled to the future and caught a glimpse of what’s to come.

Though I briefly fell into a state of nihilism, I am now certain that this will be an era where individual talent truly flourishes: across music, art, video, programming, professional expertise, education, healthcare, gaming, and economics.

The world of musicians has collapsed. Below is a track synthesized by the AI music software Suno, using the voices of Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber to sing Jay Chou’s "One Last Time + Coral Sea." Doesn't it sound surprisingly good?

For art and video, the release of Sora 2 was already a massive shock, and Google’s Nano Banana has only made things more challenging for creators.

As for programming, words are hardly needed. When I was working on a project in Japan earlier this year, my first exploration of Cursor already felt impactful. Now that Cursor can function as an Agent, it is simply staggering. I finally understand why Silicon Valley tech giants are conducting mass layoffs—because those roles are simply no longer needed.

We are all but a grain of sand in this era. When the Great Tide washes over us, perhaps only 20% will survive to continue the working models and social mechanisms brought about by the previous Industrial Revolution. I believe a new Industrial Revolution has already begun. By the end of 2025 or 2026, we shall see how future generations write and define this period of history.

Regarding healthcare: for a discipline that relies so heavily on memory and experience, it will be far too easy for AI to take over—it’s essentially a "dimensionality reduction strike." At least for the GPs in the NHS, they will become entirely redundant; the only thing missing is AI’s legal license to prescribe medication.

Education, gaming, economics... the list goes on and on.

If no "force majeure" interrupts the development of AI, it can empower almost every individual, giving everyone the chance to truly stand on the shoulders of giants. Language and imagination will be the only remaining boundaries of cognition.

Thinking about it this way—isn't AI just the man-made "Akashic Records" of our modern age?

At the beginning of the year, I thought power electronics still had industry barriers to serve as a moat. By the end of the year, I have completely abandoned that thought.

2026, let the storm rage even harder!
